\title{Add Assumptions and Caveats to a Data Frame}
\usage{
add_assumptions(df, assumptions = NULL, caveats = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame to which assumptions and caveats will be attached.}

\item{assumptions}{A character vector of assumptions about the data.
These are appended to any existing assumptions stored in the data frame's
attributes. Default is NULL (no assumptions added).}

\item{caveats}{A character vector of caveats or limitations about the data.
These are appended to any existing caveats stored in the data frame's
attributes. Default is NULL (no caveats added).}
}
\value{
The input data frame with updated "assumptions" and "caveats"
attributes. The data frame itself is unchanged; only its metadata is modified.
}
\description{
Attaches assumptions and caveats as attributes to a data frame object.
This allows you to document important context, limitations, or conditions
that apply to the data. Subsequent calls append to existing assumptions
and caveats rather than replacing them.
}
\examples{
# Create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(x = 1:5, y = 6:10)

# Add assumptions and caveats
df <- add_assumptions(
  df,
  assumptions = c("Data collected during normal business hours",
                  "Sample size may be limited"),
  caveats = "Results not validated for extreme values"
)

# Add more assumptions later (they append, not replace)
df <- add_assumptions(
  df,
  assumptions = "Assumes linear relationship"
)

# View the attributes
attr(df, "assumptions")
attr(df, "caveats")
}

\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame or \code{sf} object containing indicator data. Must include
at minimum columns for year, value, and an identifier for spatial location
(e.g., area ID, site, or coordinates).}

\item{scoring}{Character. Method used to score the indicator. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{"desired trend"} – Uses regression to score based on increase,
decrease, or stability.
\item \code{"representation"} – Scores based on \% overlap of feature within
protected areas.
\item \code{"median"} – Uses median value of raster or continuous data, rescaled
to 0–100.
\item \code{"control site comparison"} – Compares trends inside vs. outside
managed areas.
}}

\item{direction}{Character. If \code{"inverse"}, scores are reversed (e.g., lower
values are better).}

\item{areas}{An \code{sf} polygon object defining the areas of interest (e.g.,
conservation areas, regions). Used for spatial joins and reporting.}

\item{areaID}{Character. The name of the column in \code{areas} and \code{data} used to
match records to geographic areas.}

\item{type}{Character. Type of indicator (e.g., "biological", "habitat",
"climate").}

\item{units}{Character. Units of the indicator (e.g., "kg/ha", "\% cover").}

\item{indicator}{Character. Indicator name or short description.}

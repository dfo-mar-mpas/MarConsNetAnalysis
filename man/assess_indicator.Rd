\description{
Calculates indicator scores and associated status and trend summaries
for a given indicator dataset, based on a specified scoring method.
}
\details{
This function supports multiple indicator scoring frameworks used in
the MarConsNet analysis workflow, including:
\itemize{
\item \strong{trend‑based scoring} (linear regression over time),
\item \strong{representation} (proportion of area or occurrences within MPAs),
\item \strong{coverage} (coverage of features relative to conservation targets),
\item \strong{median} (median value relative to maximum),
\item \strong{control site comparisons} (difference inside vs outside MPAs).
}

The function returns a tibble with one row per area, including
numeric scores (0–100), data summaries, and human‑readable
status and trend statements.

\title{Convert numeric scores to letter grades}
\usage{
calc_letter_grade(scores)
}
\arguments{
\item{scores}{Numeric vector of scores to convert to letter grades. Scores are
internally floored to integers before grading.}
}
\value{
Character vector of the same length as \code{scores}, containing
letter grades: "A", "B", "C", "D", "F", or "NA".
}
\description{
Translates numeric scores (0–100) into letter grades using standard
intervals: F (0–20), D (20–40), C (40–60), B (60–80), and A (80–100).
Scores outside 0–100 are treated as NA. NA or NaN scores are returned as "NA".
}
\details{
The grading scale is inclusive of the lower bound and exclusive of the
upper bound for all intervals except for F (0–20) and A (80–100), which
include both endpoints.
}

calc_letter_grade(c(95, 73, 55, 38, 15, NA, NaN))

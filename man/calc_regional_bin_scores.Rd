\title{Calculate regional bin-level weighted scores}
\usage{
calc_regional_bin_scores(df, target_bin_weight = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing indicator scores and metadata. Must
include at least the columns \code{target_name}, \code{region},
\code{scale}, \code{score}, \code{weight}, \code{objective},
\code{bin}, \code{areaID}, and \code{PPTID}.}

\item{target_bin_weight}{Numeric scalar giving the total weight assigned
to each bin when calculating regional scores. Default is \code{1}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with regional bin-level scores calculated and
appended to the original input data.
}
\description{
Calculates weighted mean indicator scores at the regional bin level.
Multiscale indicators are handled by assigning the regional-scale score
and excluding site-level contributions from regional calculations.
Results are aggregated by objective and bin, reweighted within each bin,
and then recombined with the original data, including
\code{"Non_Conservation_Area"} entries.
}
\details{
The function:
\enumerate{
\item Identifies multiscale indicators (those with more than one scale
per target and region).
\item Assigns regional-scale scores to multiscale indicators and excludes
site-level scores from regional aggregation.
\item Calculates weighted mean scores at the bin level within regions.
\item Redistributes bin weights evenly across indicators in each bin.
\item Binds the calculated regional scores back to the full original
dataset.

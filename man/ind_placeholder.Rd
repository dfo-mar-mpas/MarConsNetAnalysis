\arguments{

\item{areaName}{Indicates what column in areas data frame MPA names can be
found}

Available', 'Not currently collected', 'Conceptual', or 'Unknown'.}

\item{source}{indicates where data comes from}

\item{objectives}{indicates the management objective an indicator informs}

\item{theme}{a character string of length 1 of either "Ocean Conditions",
"Ocean Structure and Movement","Primary Production","Secondary Production",
"Marine Mammals and Other Top Predators", "Trophic Structure and Function",
"Benthic Environment", "Fish and Fishery Resources",

\description{
Generates a standardized placeholder data frame for an indicator,
suitable for initializing indicator structures when data are not
yet available. This allows the MarConsNet framework to maintain
consistent columns and metadata across sites or areas, even for
indicators that are not yet collected or conceptual.

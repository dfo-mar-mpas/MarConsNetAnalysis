\title{Create a weighted indicator flower plot}
\usage{
plot_flowerplot(
  df,
  grouping = "grouping",
  labels = "labels",
  score = "score",
  weight = "weight",
  title = unique(df[["area_name"]]),
  max_score = 100,
  min_score = 0,
  bintextsize = 3,
  zeroline = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing indicator scores and weights. Must
include columns referenced by \code{grouping}, \code{labels},
\code{score}, \code{weight}, and optionally \code{area_name}.}

\item{grouping}{Character string giving the column name used to group indicators
(e.g. indicator category or theme).}

\item{labels}{Character string giving the column name used as indicator labels.}

\item{score}{Character string giving the column name containing numeric
indicator scores.}

\item{weight}{Character string giving the column name containing indicator
weights. Weights are normalized internally to sum to 1.}

\item{title}{Plot title. Defaults to the unique value of
\code{df[["area_name"]]}. Set to \code{FALSE} to suppress the
title.}

\item{max_score}{Numeric maximum value of the scoring scale.}

\item{min_score}{Numeric minimum value of the scoring scale.}

\item{bintextsize}{Numeric text size used for group labels in the outer ring.}

\item{zeroline}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, adds a horizontal reference line at
zero.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object representing the flower plot.
}
\description{
Generates a radial "flower plot" visualization summarizing
indicator scores using weighted segments and letter-grade
classification. Individual indicators are displayed as petals,
grouped into higher-level categories, with both indicator-level
and group-level scores encoded by colour and radial extent.
}
\details{
This plot is designed to communicate overall status and
composition of indicators within a site, network, or region.

Indicator-level scores are aggregated using weighted means and
converted to letter grades via \code{calc_letter_grade()}.
Group-level scores are computed by aggregating across indicators
within each \code{grouping} category.

The flower plot uses polar coordinates where:
\itemize{
\item Petal width represents indicator weight.
\item Radial height represents indicator score.
\item Colour represents letter-grade classification.
}

Indicator labels are automatically wrapped for readability,
and missing scores are visually muted.
